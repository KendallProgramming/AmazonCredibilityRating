So far I love this product, every time I use it my hair smells good, is really soft, and has a nice shine to it.

I’m not one for product reviews but I had to on this one.  I have natural auburn hair with lots of grey. I became a strawberry blond with lots of blonde to give myself a new look at an old age. I have 5 auto immune diseases with lupus being one so my hair is thinning and extremely dry.  Never in my entire life have I used anything that is this good.  My hair is softer than it has ever in 60 years been.  Two tiny pumps every nite and no sticky or stiff residue. After only a couple times I couldn’t believe it.  I have thinning but still rather thick coarse natural curly hair and this stuff is incredible. My hair is softer and looks better than it ever has.  Can’t say enough good things about this miracle product and smells fantastic. Now if you could only make something this good for wrinkles!!  Ona fixed income I hesitated to spend the money but oh my…worth every penny and only a surprisingly tiny amount each night does the trick. Very impressed.', 'amount_reviews': 1733}, {'review_product': 'Kerastase Absolu Overnight Recovery Cicanuit', 'review_title': 'Huge difference!', 'review_stars': 5.0, 'review_date': '02112022', 'review_length': 928, 'review_body': 'I recently went from dark brown to highlighted hair. I have a lot of damage from bleach, heat tools, having long hair and not getting enough haircuts, etc. I have breakage and split ends. Wow this overnight hair serum is absolutely fantastic! First off it smells soooo good. The consistency is not greasy or oily on the hair. My hair soaks it right up. The first time I used it I saw a huge difference in softness, smoothing, frizz and manageability. Over continued use it has really made a big difference in the way my hair looks and feels. It also improves my “bed head” when I wake up. Yes I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone with bleached, highlights, color treated, dry, damaged hair, etc. I have fine textured thin hair but I think this would work on a wide variety of different hair types. I love that it doesn’t weigh down my hair! I apply multiple pumps on the mid length and ends multiple times a week.', 'amount_reviews': 1733}, {'review_product': 'Kerastase Absolu Overnight Recovery Cicanuit', 'review_title': 'Doesn’t work miracles, but definitely hel', 'review_stars': 4.0, 'review_date': '05082024', 'review_length': 1170, 'review_body': 'My hair is extremely dry and damaged, so of course I’m always looking for the miracle product that’s gonna change my life. I use heated tools, box color my hair, and live in an extremely dry environment. The ends of my long hair are like straw and have split ends. I’m looking for a product that will help moisturize, repair and give a little shine. After reading reviews I decided to give it a shot.I follow the instructions and put a couple pumps in my hand and distribute the product through my hair before bed, concentrating on the ends. The smell is pleasant and wears off by morning and the product feels nice, light and not sticky. I’ve noticed the ends of my hair appear less dry the following morning. It does an okay job, but nothing mind blowing. The only con for me is the price. $60 is double what I usually pay for other hair products. The glass bottle is nice heavy quality and because I only use a few pumps every night, I feel like you get a good amount of product and the bottle should last a while. The jury is out on if I will repurchase, but because of the high price, it unlikely. If you hair isn’t as damaged as mine, this may work better for you.', 'amount_reviews': 1733}, {'review_product': 'Kerastase Absolu Overnight Recovery Cicanuit', 'review_title': 'I think it works!', 'review_stars': 5.0, 'review_date': '01262024', 'review_length': 385, 'review_body': 'I have been using this for about 4 days and i have to say my hair already seems lighter and brighter and softer even!!!
