The mouse that had come along with my desktop was finally on its last legs after about five years of use (hey, if it worked fine, why replace it?) and subsequently died completely right after I'd placed the order for this one. Good thing I was proactive and went hunting when the old one started having issues!>This little guy fit all the criteria I had when shopping and after about a week of use is performing every bit as well and comfortably as the last one! I like how it's simple and basic, much like my old one. It's a good size for my hand and is nicely shaped (I hate those ergonomic mice that are built short and tall) so it's comfortable to use and feels nice to the touch, all smooth plastic. The buttons work nicely, the wheel scrolls smoothly and only makes a mild clicking, and it has a USB cable (I'm not a fan of wireless mice; they seem less reliable and require more maintenance in my experience). Plus, I was able to get mine for like $5 which was very nice! I was only after a basic, reliable computer mouse to replace my broken one and this one fits the bill! I've used it extensively since it arrived at my door and works wonderfully! My only qualm is that I would have liked for the cord to be a little longer, just to have enough slack to be extra safe, but so far it fits in with my current desktop setup so I won't complain.If you're in the market for a basic, corded mouse that operates smoothly and is comfortable to use, I highly recommend! It's nothing fancy, but it is responsive, comfortable, and I can't find any point of contention with it or its performance. I'm just glad such a simple corded is even still in production! Logitech has always made products I find to be useful and reliable, so I felt confident buying a mouse made by the company.I'll update this review in a few months time (or sooner, if there's a problem) just as a check in on its longevity and functionality over time!Update as of January 24th, 2018Everything is still working wonderfully after almost half a year of use!Update as of July 12th, 2018Still working perfectly almost a year in!Update as of January 2019My mouse began to do this strange thing where it'd simaltaneously right click as I left clicked, which caused me to accidentally select random parts of the right click menu while using my computer. Nothing I did corrected the issue in a way that would keep me using the mouse, so it is put to rest after about 18 months of daily use.The issue stopped when I switched my left click and right click controls to the opposite buttons, but as I am right handed, this was awkward, so I bought a new mouse. My only guess as to why this happened was that the components of the mouse where worn; there's not a super clear distinction between the left and right buttons (there's a single piece of plastic over the two that's just been cut down the middle) so perhaps wear and tear caused some warping that makes it so pressure on the left button side causes the mouse's sensors to feel like the right side is clicking.br>", 'amount_reviews': 38183}, {'review_product': 'Logitech B100 Corded Mouse Computers', 'review_title': 'Great mouse!', 'review_stars': 5.0, 'review_date': '04182024', 'review_length': 519, 'review_body': "I bought this mouse when the trackpad on my aged Macbook Pro began to fail, and it works great.

It does an okay job, but nothing mind blowing. The only con for me is the price. $60 is double what I usually pay for other hair products. The glass bottle is nice heavy quality and because I only use a few pumps every night, I feel like you get a good amount of product and the bottle should last a while.
